## Admin API authorization
To authorize your requests to Admin API you need to use your license key that you can find in the VXG dashboard: https://dashboard.videoexpertsgroup.com/?products=

The API Key should be injected to Authorization header of every request to Admin API like this:

Authorization: LKey %license_key%
For example, if the API key is "X9tKpuXq0btatj":

Authorization: LKey X9tKpuXq0btatj
Non-admin API authorization
All function calls require an authorization header.

'Authorization: Acc %channel_access_token%'
The %channel_access_token% can be retrieved in two ways:
a. Using Admin API during creating a channel or updating of a channel access token.
b. Using Cloud/Server Admin UI page.

Example of an authorization header:

'Authorization: Acc eyJhY2Nlc3MiOiAid2F0Y2giLCAidG9rZW4iOiAic2hhcmUuZXlKemFTSTZJRE14T0RoOS41YWEyMjA2N3QxMmNmZjc4MC5GVHpEeUZMYkVLQVNzM2ZJRFZaSDdFMEhhdGMiLCAiY2FtaWQiOiAxMzI0NDUsICJjbW5ncmlkIjogMTMyODUwLCAiYXBpIjogIndlYi5za3l2ci52aWRlb2V4cGVydHNncm91cC5jb20ifQ=='
